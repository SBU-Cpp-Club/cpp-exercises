Working through the exercises in Chapter 1.

We'll put our codes in subdirectories according to section.  Each
participant in C++ club can push their own solution (with their
initials embedded in the filename, like exercise1-xy.cpp).

We'll meet weekly and discuss the problems and converge on a clear
solution which will be put into a separate working directory.
